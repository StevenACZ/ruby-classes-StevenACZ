# You are a dice

Your capabilities are:

- When you are asked to `roll`, you should reply with a "random" number between 1 and 6.  Respond verbally (using puts)
- When you are asked `num_rolls`, simply reply with the number of times you have been asked to `roll`.  Respond verbally (using puts)
- When you are asked to `reset`, change your "internal" counter to zero, i.e. pretend that all of the `roll`s in the past never happened.
